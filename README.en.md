  > Note: Currently Cocos Creator version 3.0.0 ~ 3.4.0 does not support interface jsb.saveImageData, the Engine Team plans to support in version 3.5.0, to save imageData as a local png file need to refer to the following PR ans customizated the engine code. https://gitee.com/zzf2019/engine-native/ commit/1ddb6ec9627a8320cd3545d353d8861da33282a8 (this PR only supports saving png, and only supports ios, android)

  > Cocos Creator 3.4.0 also has a readPixels bug, need to merge PR manually: https://github.com/cocos-creator/engine/pull/9900/files

  > - Currently only models with builtin-unlit materials are supported for cutting.
  > - the engine module requires a Bullet-based physics engine.
  > - setting CullMode to None for materials will improve the cutting of mesh through-moulds to some extent, but performance will be reduced.
  > - there is currently no adaptation of the cut function to rotated model nodes, so you need to ensure that the model is not rotated.
  > - the performance of the current scheme is not optimal
  > - the default detection accuracy between two points is 1/256, at which point too small fragments cannot be cut. The accuracy can be improved by increasing the raycastCount, but the performance will be reduced.
  > - not all model nodes will not be cut through, this is related to the original mesh of the model, for reasons that are unclear.
  > - cut meshCollider fragments are currently unable to physically collide.

  > Note: The current 3.0.0 ~ 3.4.1 versions of the ios platform will shift the click position after calling the native trans-screen function, so you need to merge the pr manually: https://github.com/cocos-creator/engine-native/pull/4265, the merged pr file is included in the demo.
